A user can then reload the page and be able to see a list of previous cities searched. These cities can be clicked on to see the weather for each one.

## Next Update

A way to be able to auto-populate the previous cities searched would be great. A problem was that if a forced page reload was initiated on search, none of the divs could populate with the weather information because the page refresh would delete them. That is why the best option was to allow the history to be loaded on a refresh or when the user revisits the page.
